This is the server portion of the Chambermaid project.

Essentially it can pass data between a FHEM backend and clients
that can work with JSON. It is meant to be used with 
chambermaid-frontend though.

This code has some pretty rough edges and is probably not suited
to be used anywhere but at my place.
